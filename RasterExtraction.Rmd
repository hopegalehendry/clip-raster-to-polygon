# This code is for the purpose of clipping multiple raster files to a single polygon.
# Input: Polygon and raster files
# Output: .tif of clippes raster

### Workflow ###
# 1. load libraries
# 2. establish files and file paths
# 3. Load polygon of interest
# 4. Check CRS of polygon and rasters
# 4b.Make sure they match with the 'project' fxn
# 5. Prepare for 'for' loop by setting range variable and defining file variable with catenation
# 6. Loop!
# - for each file in years, if the file exists, load it, crop it, mask it, save it, 
################

### Load Libraries ###

library(terra)

### SET FILE PATHS ### 

polygon <- ("/Users/hopewolfchild/Desktop/Python Project/Horsefly_polygon/Horesefly_polygon.shp")
land_cover <- ("/Users/hopewolfchild/Desktop/Data/Land Cover/NLCD 1985-2023/")
output_folder <- ("/Users/hopewolfchild/Desktop/Python Project/tiffs")

### LOAD POLYGON OF INTEREST ###

hf_polygon <- vect(polygon)

### CHECK COORDINATE REF SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THEY WILL OVERLAP RIGHT ### 
print(crs(hf_polygon))
sample_raster <- (crs(rast(paste0(land_cover, "NLCD_2020.tif"))))
print(sample_raster)

### IF NEEDED REPROJECT POLYGON TO MATCH RASTER CRS ###

hf_polygon <- project(hf_polygon, crs(sample_raster))

### NOW PREPARE FOR A FOR LOOP ###
### Create range of years and define files ###

years <- 1985:2023
nlcd_files <- paste0(land_cover, "NLCD_", years, ".tif")

### LOOP ###

### Loop through each year, load the corresponding raster, crop it to the polygon, and save it.

# for each year in the years sequence
for (i in seq_along(years)) {
  
  # the file we will use refers to the nlcd files, we will call it raster_file
  raster_file <- nlcd_files[i]
  
  # if the files exists
  if (file.exists(raster_file)) {
    # load the file
    nlcd_raster <- rast(raster_file)
    
    # crop the file to the extent of the polygon
    cropped_raster <- crop(nlcd_raster, hf_polygon)  
    
    # mask the na pixels around it
    masked_raster <- mask(cropped_raster, hf_polygon)
    
    # Define output file name
    output_file <- paste0(output_folder, "NLCD_", years[i], "_cropped_hf.tif")
    
    # Save the output raster - datatype is important here! overwrite just means if it already exists itll replace it
    writeRaster(masked_raster, output_file, datatype = "INT1U", overwrite = TRUE)
    
    # Print progress
    cat("Processed and saved:", output_file, "\n")
  } else {
    # If the file does not exist, print a warning
    cat("File not found:", raster_file, "\n")
  }
}
